# About The Project
***
 ![img.png](img/webpage sample.png)
To curb the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, companies have to monitor the health of employees and keep track of
close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases within the company. Given that this is a rather new process for companies, 
most of these processes are done manually. In order to improve productivity in the workplace, we have designed this web
application to help companies with the following:
* Keep track of departments within the company
* Keep track of employees within each department
* Remind employees to declare their temperature daily
* Provide alerts when an employee is having a fever
* Keep track of employees that are in contact during meetings
* Identify employees who have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive cases during meetings

### Built With
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

# Getting started
***

### Prerequisites

* npm

Run `npm install` to get required packages. Run `npm start` and point `localhost:3000` to view development server.

### Installation
You will need to create an `.env` file to hide database credentials - This can be a new database, or if you still have the 2102 database you can just use that one. In the `.env` file:
* DB_USER=YOUR_USER       // should be postgres
* DB_HOST=127.0.0.1       // this represents localhost, we will migrate to an online db later
* DATABASE=YOUR_OWN_DB
* DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_OWN_PASSWORD
* DB_PORT=5432            //default I believe is 5432


## Using Postman (For BE testing of API calls)
You can download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) here.
A sample query is shown below: 
![Sample Postman Query](/img/Postman-sample.png)

This occurs cause of this line, and is just an example:
```
app.post('/user', (req, res) => {
    pool.query('SELECT * FROM departments', (error, results) => {
        if (error) {
          throw error
        }
        res.status(200).json(results.rows)
    })
})
```

## Local PSQL DB instructions

Step 1: Create a new database

Log into PostgreSQL (e.g., with psql) and create a new database, e.g.

CREATE DATABASE cs2102_project;  -- Feel free to pick your own name



Step 2: Import dump into the newly create database, e.g.:

psql  -d cs2102_project  -f schema.sql  -U postgres  -- you might need to add the full path where schema.sql is located
psql  -d cs2102_project  -f proc.sql  -U postgres
psql  -d cs2102_project  -f data.sql  -U postgres
